<h1>My WeThinkCode_ Prep Journey</h1>
<p>Hey, I’m Millie. This repo is where I’m tracking everything I’m learning as I get ready for the WeThinkCode_ course starting in September 2025.
<hr>
<h3>What’s going on here?</h3>
Before the course starts, I have a learning plan to follow so I can build a solid base and not get overwhelmed later.

<h3>How I’m doing this</h3>
I’ll have check-ins every two weeks on Fridays with my Performance Manager to talk about what I’ve done so far.

I’m trying to stick to the schedule so I stay on track, but I’m also flexible—stuff happens.

All my work will be saved here in this repo — code, notes, projects, everything.

This README is basically my journal where I’ll write about what I’ve learned, what was hard, and what I feel good about.

<h3>Why it matters</h3>
This repo shows my progress to my mentors and Performance Manager so they can support me better and know where I’m at.

<h3>What’s next?</h3>
I get my Performance Manager on Monday, 07 July 2025 — looking forward to it.

If I don’t have what I need at home to do the work, I’ll fill out the form to get help.

There’s a mandatory Hackathon in August where I’ll show what I’ve learned so far.

I’ll keep this updated every check-in with what I’ve done and how I’m feeling.

Thanks for stopping by!
— Millie</p>
