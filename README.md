<div align="center"><h2>My WeThinkCode_ Prep Journey</h2></div>
Hi, I’m Millie. This repository is my personal learning journal as I prepare for the WeThinkCode_ course starting in September 2025.

<div align="center"><h2>📌 What’s This About?</h2></div>
Before the course officially begins, I’ve got a self-driven learning plan to help me build a strong foundation. The goal? To walk into day one confident and ready.

<div align="center"><h2>✅ How I’m Doing It</h2></div>
I’ll be doing bi-weekly check-ins (every second Friday) with my Performance Manager to review progress.

I'm following a learning schedule, but I’m keeping it realistic and flexible.

Everything I do — code, notes, projects — will be tracked in this repo.

This README will serve as my journal, where I reflect on what I’ve learned, what I’ve struggled with, and what I’m proud of.

<div align="center"><h2>❓ Why This Repo Exists</h2></div>
This is more than a GitHub repo. It’s a transparent record of my journey for:

Myself, to stay motivated and organized.

My mentors, to see my progress and offer support.

My Performance Manager, to track learning outcomes and guide me when I get stuck.

<div align="center"><h2>📅 What’s Coming Up?</h2></div>
Performance Manager onboarding: Monday, 7 July 2025.

Hackathon: Happening in August. It’s a chance to showcase everything I’ve learned so far.

Support requests: If I don’t have the tools or resources I need at home, I’ll submit a request through the official channel.

I’ll be updating this file every check-in to reflect new wins, lessons, and challenges.

Thanks for stopping by!
— Millie
